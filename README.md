# Soccer-Player-Rating-Analysis-DAND
- This is a project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity
- I queried a large database that has soccer related data; I believe it's located on Git or Kaggle.
- My query:
  - I queried data related to soccer player skills and the rating of those skills
  - For this project, I did some basic data wrangling and exploratory data analysis based on insights from the data I queried from the database
 - Insights: Centered around the a player's rating
  - Does footedness matter in soccer
  - Age
  - Ratings of players increasing or decreasing year after year
  - Potential reached
  
#### Fun project, since I love soccer.  The EDA and data wrangling is very basic and simple with basic descriptive stats.  I really enjoyed exploring this database
